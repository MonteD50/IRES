Intro: Get insipried by
    - Distance based Clustering of Class Association Rules to 
Build a Compact, Accurate and Descriptive Classifier paper


Related Work:

    - CMAR
    - MAC


Methodology:
    - CAR generation: Distance based Clustering of Class Association Rules to 
Build a Compact, Accurate and Descriptive Classifier paper
        - support, confidence, etc.
        - fpgrowth and why we used: because faster/ better time complexity (find out what time complexity this and apriori is) and similiar results as apriori
    - Clustering: 
        - Distance: Explain and show example binary distance
            - Rephrase section 4.2 in PhD thesis
            - Hamming distance
        - Kmodes: because it is for categorical data
            - Identifying Optimal number of clusters: Shiloute score, how it works with algorithm
            - Explain kmodes
            - Show algorithm for our method: distance, optimal clusters, kmodes


Cluster Representation (rephrase):
    - 6.2: Representative CAR based on dataset coverage in PhD thesis
    - Algorithm (similiar to algorithm 14) but change to show avoid overlapping and three rules per cluster
    - Final classifier: combine all the steps, show as algorithm


Results:
    - Tables
        - Table 1: dataset info (See table 7.1 in PhD thesis without min support and min confidence and # of analyzed rules)
        - Table 2: Accuracy for each dataset (big table)
        - Table 3: Number of rules for each dataset (LATER: statistical significance testing)


Conclusion:
    - Rephrase from Distance based Clustering of Class Association Rules to 
Build a Compact, Accurate and Descriptive Classifier paper
